# Learning go

This repo tracks the resources I've been reading to ramp up on Go. It also provides the programs I wrote in Go, as a way to experiment the feature of this language. Hopefully it will help you too!

Resources:
  - [A tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/welcome/1): This is where to start: Excellent tutorial that introduces the Go language. 
  - [How to write Go code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html): How to get started with your own environment.
  - [Working with Go](https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go) repo. Gives a few examples.
  - [DevFreeBooks](http://devfreebooks.org/): [The little book of Go](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/?utm_source=devfreebooks&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=DevFreeBooks)
